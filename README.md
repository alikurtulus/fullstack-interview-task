# Moneyhub Tech Test - Investments and Holdings

At Moneyhub we use microservices to partition and separate the concerns of the codebase. In this exercise we have given you an example `admin` service and some accompanying services to work with. In this case the admin service backs a front end admin tool allowing non-technical staff to interact with data.

A request for a new admin feature has been received

## Requirements

- As an admin, I want to be able to generate a CSV report showing the values of all user investment holdings
    - Any new routes should be added to the **admin** service
    - The csv report should be sent to the `/export` route of the **investments** service
    - The investments `/export` route expects the following:
        - content-type as `application/json`
        - JSON object containing the report as csv string, i.e, `{csv: '|User|First Name|...'}`
    - The csv should contain a row for each holding matching the following headers
    |User|First Name|Last Name|Date|Holding|Value|
    - The **Holding** property should be the name of the holding account given by the **financial-companies** service
    - The **Value** property can be calculated by `investmentTotal * investmentPercentage`
    - The new route in the admin service handling the generation of the csv report should return the csv as text with content type `text/csv`
- Ensure use of up to date packages and libraries (the service is known to use deprecated packages but there is no expectation to replace them)
- Make effective use of git

We prefer:
- Functional code
- Ramda.js (this is not a requirement but feel free to investigate)
- Unit testing

### Notes
All of you work should take place inside the `admin` microservice

For the purposes of this task we would assume there are sufficient security middleware, permissions access and PII safe protocols, you do not need to add additional security measures as part of this exercise.

You are free to use any packages that would help with this task

We're interested in how you break down the work and build your solution in a clean, reusable and testable manner rather than seeing a perfect example, try to only spend around *1-2 hours* working on it

## Deliverables
**Please make sure to update the readme with**:

- Your new routes
- How to run any additional scripts or tests you may have added
- Relating to the task please add answers to the following questions;
    1. How might you make this service more secure?
    - Using authentication and authorization methods. Authentication checks user identity. This will prevent any unidentified user attacks.
    Authorization grants access rights to a user or machine. Authorisation logic to ensure that only authorized users can access the admin service and its functionalities.
    - Using TLS or MTLS. They help build a network where every interaction between services is secure.
    - Using monitoring tools. This will provide a clearer view of the system and help you locate security issues faster.
    - Using Encrypt and protect secrets keys. Environment Variables should not be exposed within the code. We can use AWS Secret Manager or Github Secrets to protect our secret keys.
    2. How would you make this solution scale to millions of records?
    -  Use a database to store the records so that they can be quickly retrieved in a single query.
    - Cache the data retrieved frequently to reduce database reads and operational time and costs.
    - Use Load balancer for microservices aims to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple instances of a service to ensure no single instance is overwhelmed with too much traffic.

    3. What else would you have liked to improve given more time?
    - Investigate Ramda.js and implement this task with Ramda.js
    - Write up through documentation on the API usage.
    - Better error handling to give the clear response for the user. 
    - Add more tests for failing scenarios.



On completion email a link to your repository to your contact at Moneyhub and ensure it is publicly accessible.

## Getting Started

Please clone this service and push it to your own github (or other) public repository

To develop against all the services each one will need to be started in each service run

```bash
npm start
or
npm run develop
```

The develop command will run nodemon allowing you to make changes without restarting

The services will try to use ports 8081, 8082 and 8083

Use Postman or any API tool of you choice to trigger your endpoints (this is how we will test your new route).

### Testing

Unit tests have been written for the new utility functions in Jest.

To run the unit tests, run

`npm test`

### Existing routes
We have provided a series of routes

Investments - localhost:8081
- `/investments` get all investments
- `/investments/:id` get an investment record by id
- `/investments/export` expects a csv formatted text input as the body

Financial Companies - localhost:8082
- `/companies` get all companies details
- `/companies/:id` get company by id

Admin - localhost:8083
- `/investments/:id` get an investment record by id
- `/generate-csv`  generates a CSV file of all user investment holdings
